description: "The Rise of Silas Lapham is a realist novel by William Dean Howells\
  \ published in 1885. The story follows the materialistic rise of Silas Lapham from\
  \ rags to riches, and his ensuing moral susceptibility. Silas earns a fortune in\
  \ the paint business, but he lacks social standards, which he tries to attain through\
  \ his daughter's marriage into the aristocratic Corey family. Silas' morality does\
  \ not fail him. He loses his money but makes the right moral decision when his partner\
  \ proposes the unethical selling of the mills to English settlers.\nHowells is known\
  \ to be the father of American realism, and a denouncer of the sentimental novel.\
  \ The resolution of the love triangle of Irene Lapham, Tom Corey, and Penelope Lapham\
  \ highlights Howells' rejection of the conventions of sentimental romantic novels\
  \ as unrealistic and deceitful.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
